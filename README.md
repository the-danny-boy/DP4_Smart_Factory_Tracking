# DP4_Smart_Factory_Tracking
This is the repository for the Individual Research Project, as part of the CENG30013 Design Project 4 module of the Engineering Design course at the University of Bristol.

## Project Objective
The project objective is to investigate the applicability of novel computer vision methods for production line environments, working towards end-to-end traceability through persistent detection and tracking. The system should be capable of tracking items throughout the production line, as well as accumulating damage indicators between frames. 

## Usage Information
The project is developed using Python 3.8.7, and required libraries can be installed using the requirements.txt file. Alternatively, the supplied Virtual Environment can be used. The Virtual Environment can be activated using "Virtual_Environments\my-env\Scripts\activate.bat".  

The Data Generator is built using Unity 2020.2.0f1, with the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP).
